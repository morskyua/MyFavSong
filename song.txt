Ooh (ooh)
Nah-nah, yeah
I saw you dancing in a crowded room (uh)
You look so happy when I'm not with you
But then you saw me, caught you by surprise
A single teardrop falling from your eye
I don't know why I run away (oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
I'll make you cry when I run away (oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
Take me back 'cause I wanna stay
Save your tears for another
Save your tears for another day (oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
Save your tears for another day (mm)
Met you once under a Pisces moon
I kept my distance 'cause I know that you
Don't like when I'm with nobody else
I couldn't help it, I put you through hell
